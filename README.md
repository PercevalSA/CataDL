# CataDL
Download the complete picture from http://exploration.urban.free.fr/catacombes/v5-zoom-globale.htm

## Requirements
* Image Magick http://www.imagemagick.org
* wget https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

## Usage
```bash
./dlmap.sh
```

## Precision
There are six zoom levels (from 0 to 5) but I only download the most zoomed images to have the best quality.
